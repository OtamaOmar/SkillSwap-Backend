## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Completed auth flow wiring and verified logout clears server-side session state (where applicable).
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented likes/unlikes and ensured DB prevents duplicate likes; added counts to post queries.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Connected feed data fetching; added error handling + loading skeletons.
- **Hamza Salah:** Implemented post creation form and connected create-post API; validated client-side input.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: standardize response shape for auth endpoints.
- Mohamed: implement comments + replies and make sure notifications are triggered.

### Frontend
- Omar: wire like/unlike and update UI state correctly.
- Hamza: implement comments UI + reply UI.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Need consistent post object shape between list and create responses.

## 4) Decisions
- Backend will return counts (`likes_count`, `comments_count`, ...) with each post to reduce frontend computation.
