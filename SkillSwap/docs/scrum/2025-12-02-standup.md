## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Reviewed auth refresh flow and confirmed how tokens are returned/consumed by the client.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Verified post query payload includes counts needed by the feed UI.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Audited axios interceptor logic and documented expected refresh response shape.
- **Hamza Salah:** Regression tested feed flows (create/like/comment) and logged UX issues.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: normalize refresh response (single clear token field) and update API reference.
- Mohamed: ensure delete post/view count endpoints are either implemented or removed from FE calls.

### Frontend
- Omar: update `services/api.js` to match backend refresh response.
- Hamza: fix UI glitches found during regression (loading spinners, empty lists).

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Minor endpoint mismatch risk (skills paths + view increment).

## 4) Decisions
- Keep one primary skills route group and update the other side to match.
