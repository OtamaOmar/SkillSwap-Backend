## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Implemented `/api/users/me` and protected route checks; aligned error responses for missing/invalid token.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Started posts controller work (create/list) and validated required fields with clear 400 errors.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Finished login/signup pages + token persistence; added protected routing for `/feed`.
- **Hamza Salah:** Implemented profile page layout and empty states; began skills UI components.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: confirm refresh token approach (session/refresh) and document expected payload.
- Mohamed: add likes endpoint + ensure unique like per (user, post).

### Frontend
- Omar: build `services/api.js` helpers for posts/likes; handle 401 by redirect.
- Hamza: connect skills add/delete UI to API.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Agree on whether refresh token is stored and how it is returned from login.

## 4) Decisions
- Start with access-token-based auth for MVP; refresh behavior handled via endpoint + client interceptor.
