---

## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Reviewed auth + protected routes and ensured profile endpoints require valid token.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented friendship request/accept/reject endpoints and ensured status transitions are correct.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Integrated friendship API calls and created requests list UI.
- **Hamza Salah:** Implemented suggestions UI and added clear “pending/accepted” visual states.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: ensure friendship endpoints prevent duplicates and handle self-request.
- Mohamed: add notifications triggers for friend request + accepted.

### Frontend
- Omar: add accept/reject actions + update UI without reload.
- Hamza: improve friends page empty states and loading indicators.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Need to confirm which endpoint will be used for “suggestions” and its query params.

## 4) Decisions
- Use `friendships` routes as the source of truth for request lifecycle; FE will display status from server.
