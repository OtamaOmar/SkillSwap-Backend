## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Initialized routing structure and auth pages; wired axios base URL config.
- **Hamza Salah:** Built basic UI scaffolding (layout/header/sidebar) and started profile/feed pages.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: finalize refresh endpoint contract and document response fields.
