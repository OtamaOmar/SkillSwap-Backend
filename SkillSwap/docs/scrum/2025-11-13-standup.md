## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Reviewed users/profile update endpoints and ensured input validation for bio/location/country.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented comments endpoints and verified comment threading via `parent_comment_id`.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Hooked comments fetch + create into feed page; improved API error mapping.
- **Hamza Salah:** Added UI for comment list + reply; validated empty/long content handling.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: implement/upload endpoints for avatar/cover (multipart + URL fallback).
- Mohamed: implement shares + post search; confirm indexing/performance basics.

### Frontend
- Omar: implement profile edit form; ensure save updates local state.
- Hamza: polish post cards (counts, timestamps) and add share button.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- File uploads depend on deployment path permissions; will test locally first.

## 4) Decisions
- Keep upload endpoints simple for MVP: accept either file (multipart) or URL JSON.
