## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Added safeguards for friendship endpoints (no self-request, duplicate pending checks) and aligned status codes.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented notification creation for key events (friend request, message, like/comment) and verified read/unread flags.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Connected notifications list + mark-as-read actions; created badge/unread count display.
- **Hamza Salah:** Polished friends + notifications pages (empty/loading/error states) and improved navigation between pages.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: document notification payload schema and ensure stable ordering by `created_at`.
- Mohamed: begin chat endpoints (threads, send message, fetch history) and prepare SSE stream behavior.

### Frontend
- Omar: integrate notifications badge refresh on key actions.
- Hamza: build chat UI skeleton and conversation list layout.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Real-time updates: decide between polling vs SSE for notifications and messages.

## 4) Decisions
- Use SSE for chat stream; use periodic refresh or event-triggered fetch for notifications in MVP.
