## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Verified auth + refresh behavior and aligned error codes for 401/403.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Checked posts/comments/likes logic against DB constraints and fixed edge cases.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Connected protected routes and improved axios refresh retry logic.
- **Hamza Salah:** Polished feed + profile UI states and tested end-to-end.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: finalize refresh response field naming in docs and code.
- Mohamed: confirm missing alignment endpoints (delete post/view count) and decide final behavior.

### Frontend
- Omar: update `services/api.js` to match the decided refresh/token shape.
- Hamza: continue UI regression pass and fix remaining edge cases.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- FE/BE endpoint naming mismatches (skills paths) can break integration if not standardized.

## 4) Decisions
- Standardize skills API under `/api/skills` and update the client calls accordingly.
