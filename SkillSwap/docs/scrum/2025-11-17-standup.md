## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Completed avatar/cover upload endpoints (multipart + URL body); verified files served from `/uploads`.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented post search endpoint and share action; confirmed counts update correctly.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Integrated profile edit + avatar/cover update calls; ensured UI updates without refresh.
- **Hamza Salah:** Implemented post share UI and search bar; improved empty state messages.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: add additional auth checks to upload endpoints and validate mime types.
- Mohamed: start friendships lifecycle endpoints (request/accept/reject/list).

### Frontend
- Omar: integrate search endpoint in feed.
- Hamza: add share confirmation + improve search results UX.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Search results should match exactly what UI expects (paging + shape).

## 4) Decisions
- Search will be server-side (backend filters) to avoid heavy client-side computation.
