## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Verified CORS/env configuration for local runs and documented required environment variables.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Ran a quick integration check on friendships + notifications and fixed small response inconsistencies.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Verified build runs clean and updated error handling for API failures.
- **Hamza Salah:** Polished final UI details (spacing, empty states, button disable rules) and re-tested the main user flows.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: confirm final behavior for any planned-but-missing endpoints (delete post/view count) and update docs accordingly.
- Mohamed: finalize chat unread counts and mark-as-read behavior.

### Frontend
- Omar: do a full smoke test and note any remaining FE/BE mismatches.
- Hamza: prepare screenshots (optional) for documentation/report submission.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Last-minute endpoint changes can break the client; freeze API shape until submission.

## 4) Decisions
- Freeze feature scope; focus on stability + documentation for submission.
