---

## Keep (what went well)
- Fast daily syncs helped unblock integration.
- Clear split of BE/FE responsibilities made progress steady.

## Problem (what was hard)
- Meeting notes were not recorded live (harder to reference decisions later).
- A few FE/BE endpoint naming mismatches caused rework.

## Try (actions for next sprint)
- Write a 5-minute summary after each sync using `docs/scrum/MEETING_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Create/maintain a GitHub Project board and link issues to PRs.
- Add CI checks early (lint/build/tests) to avoid last-minute failures.

## Owners
- **Omar (SM):** ensure meeting notes are added and board is updated.
- **Fady (BE):** maintain API reference consistency.
- **Mohamed (BE):** maintain DB constraints and edge cases.
- **Hamza (FE):** maintain UI regression checklist.
