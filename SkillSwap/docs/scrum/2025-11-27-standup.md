## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- **Fady Ragaie:** Implemented chat stream endpoint (SSE) skeleton and verified authentication on streaming routes.
- **Mohamed Bassel:** Implemented message send + history queries; ensured messages link sender/receiver correctly.

### Frontend
- **Omar Tarek:** Connected chat API send + history; added basic retry logic on failed requests.
- **Hamza Salah:** Implemented chat UI (conversation list + message view) and fixed auto-scroll-to-latest.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady: add heartbeat/reconnect guidance for SSE and ensure proper headers.
- Mohamed: add unread counts and mark-as-read behavior for conversations.

### Frontend
- Omar: integrate SSE stream listener and handle reconnect.
- Hamza: improve chat UX (loading states, empty threads, disable send when blank).

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- SSE stability varies by proxy/deployment. Need testing in a production-like environment.

## 4) Decisions
- Keep SSE events simple ("message" event + minimal payload). Client fetches full history when needed.
