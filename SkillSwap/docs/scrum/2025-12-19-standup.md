## 1) Progress since last meeting

### Backend
- Fady Ragaie: Reviewed authentication routes (login/refresh/logout) and verified protected middleware behavior; checked DB migrations run clean.
- Mohamed Bassel: Verified posts/comments/friendship controllers are consistent with DB relations; tightened validation/error responses for common bad requests.

### Frontend
- Omar Tarek: Confirmed routing + protected pages flow; aligned API base URL usage with `.env` and updated auth handling in axios.
- Hamza Salah: Polished feed + profile UI states (loading/empty/error) and validated common user flows end-to-end.

## 2) Plan until next meeting

### Backend
- Fady Ragaie: Standardize response shapes for `/api/users/me` and `/api/auth/refresh`; ensure refresh returns a single clear token field.
- Mohamed Bassel: Confirm missing/extra endpoints (delete post, increment view count) and either implement or remove frontend calls.

### Frontend
- Omar Tarek: Update `services/api.js` to match backend refresh response; add clearer toast messages for 401/403.
- Hamza Salah: Final UI regression pass on: feed create/like/comment, friends request, chat send, notifications read.

## 3) Blockers / Risks
- Minor mismatch risk between frontend expected endpoints and backend routes (skills path + delete post + view increment). Tracking as backlog alignment items.

## 4) Decisions
- Keep a single skills API path (`/api/skills`) and update the client calls accordingly.
- Treat backend as the source of truth for notification read state.
