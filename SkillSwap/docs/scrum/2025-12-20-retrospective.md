---

## Keep (what went well)
- Strong daily communication reduced delays.
- Early integration testing helped catch endpoint mismatches.
- Documentation and diagrams were finished before submission.

## Problem (what was hard)
- Some FE/BE alignment changes happened late (skills paths, token response shapes).
- Real-time (SSE) behavior can be tricky depending on environment.

## Try (actions for next time)
- Track every major decision in a short meeting note right after the call.
- Create issues for every mismatch/bug and link PRs to those issues.
- Add a small automated test suite early (backend controller tests + frontend lint/build).

## Action items & owners
- **Omar (SM):** keep board updated + meeting notes added consistently.
- **Fady (BE):** maintain API reference and stable response shapes.
- **Mohamed (BE):** harden DB constraints + edge cases.
- **Hamza (FE):** maintain UI regression checklist and smoke test steps.
